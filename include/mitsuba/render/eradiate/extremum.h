 * \brief Abstract base class for extremum structures
 *
 * ExtremumStructure provides an interface for spatial data structures that
 * store local extrema (majorant/minorant) of volumetric extinction coefficients.
 * This enables efficient use of tracking algorithms with locally-adaptive
 * majorants and minorants.
 *
 * Structures follow the pattern of an iterator: the traversal is initialized
 * with ``begin``, and segments are served in order with ``next``.
 *
 * The extremum structure needs to be built using the ``update_extremum``
 * function, it is **not** called automatically in the constructor. The caller,
 * usually a ``Medium``, passes the volumetric data the extremum is derived from.
